# Patch 0.0.1 Notes

**Version:** 0.0.1  
**Release Date:** 2026-02-15

Cadencio’s first patch turns the dashboard into a working recovery system: live analytics, debt-aware progress, and a Focus Mode that keeps you moving without staring at numbers.

## Patch Highlights
- Live Discipline Heatmap with 30/60/90-day views and streak tracking.
- Monthly Cap now tracks real spending and weekly pacing.
- Main Quest progress is based on earned net (borrowing no longer completes your ring).
- Focus Mode masks money values and shows a percent-only quest ring.
- Add obligations directly from the dashboard with priority shortcuts.

## Quest & Progress
- **Quest Progress**: Uses earned net (cashflow net minus borrowed principal) to advance the ring.
- **Quest Details**: Added Borrowed Principal, Earned Net, Debt Remaining, and Net Position for a clearer financial picture.
- **Quest Details Trend**: 30-day net history sparkline added for momentum tracking.

## Focus Mode
- **Money Masking**: Passive screens hide money values with asterisks while preserving directional context (IN/OUT).
- **Percent Ring**: The quest ring shows completion percent instead of raw amounts.

## Obligations
- **Add Obligation Modal**: Add obligations from the planning card with name, amount, and priority.
- **Planning Flow**: Monthly/Split plans now use a single Target Date for consistency.
- **Confirm Paid**: Improved reliability and comma-formatted amount handling.

## Insights (Heatmap + Cap)
- **Discipline Heatmap**: Real spending data in a scrollable, GitHub-style grid with 30/60/90-day windows.
- **Streaks**: Calculated from days at or under your daily cap.
- **Monthly Cap**: Live usage percent plus weekly mini bars to show pacing.

## Logging & Actions
- **Universal Add**: Focused on Spend/Receive (Obligation tab removed).
- **Borrowed Receive**: New Borrowed category tags principal so it can be tracked separately.
- **Recent Actions**: Shows the latest five actions with undo, compact M-format amounts, and date-only timestamps.

## Quality of Life
- **Zones**: Live balances from real transactions.
- **Last OUT**: Reflects the latest actual OUT with cost-per-hour context when income is set.
- **Onboarding**: Reset Day validation, clearer disabled states, and tighter input layout.

## Bugfixes
- Fixed the Obligation Planning modal crash (white screen).
- Simplified planning inputs for One-time/Monthly/Split consistency.
- Button states and toggles now align and render reliably.
