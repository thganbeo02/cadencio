# Unreleased Changes

## 2026-02-10

### Enhanced
- Onboarding modal layout is now square (760x680 → 680x680) so each step feels more balanced.
- Typography scale is larger (titles 28px → 32px, inputs 22px → 28px) for quicker scanning.
- Debt entry is denser with a single obligations card and inline add button, so you can compare entries faster.
- VND amounts now format with commas as you type to prevent misreading large numbers.

### Adjusted
- Priority colors now use red/yellow/green so urgency is easier to spot at a glance.
- Core documentation files now use Cadencio names to match the product identity.

### Fixed
- Toggle switches now align cleanly when toggled; the thumb no longer looks offset.
- Quest meta spacing now separates labels and values for clearer readability.
- Step 5 modal expansion keeps footer buttons anchored to their usual position.

### Adjusted
- Quest tier icons now use consistent Lucide SVGs that match the Cadencio theme.
